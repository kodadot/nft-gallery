# Contributing to KodaDot: NFT gallery


KodaDot NFT gallery has a plan to be community-owned.
We are welcoming community contribution from you.
Take a sneak peek on [good first issues](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/contribute), comment and make PR.
If everything goes well, chances that you will be **rewarded are high**. We might give retro-active bounties where bounty label wasn't present if we like your commit.

**For better coordination, please join our [Development channel Anteriors on Discord](https://discord.gg/KkctBVQ8kP)**


## Getting started

Before you being:

- Site is powered by **Node.js.** Check to see if you're on the version of **Node.js we support.**
- Please have a read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Learn how to setup your environment for the first time](FIRST_TIME.md)

### Which issue you should pick?

We're working primarily by two metrics. Issues have priorities by labels [p1-p5](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/labels), **p1 means urgent**, **p5 in research mode**. Then we have bounties for issues in range of **$ - $$$$$**.

It's up to you which issue you pick. Our **best advice is to pick issues reflecting your skillset and experience if you want to be part of internal team** if you are interested having continuous payroll from us.

### Open a pull request


When you're done making changes, and you'd like to propose them for review, use the pull request template to open your PR (Pull Request) against our `main` branch.


### Submit your PR & Get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the developers community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on **how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.**

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations! The whole Metaprime & KodaDot community thanks you. ✨

## Rewards

In way to scale our development and operations, we prefer paid trial from start to get know developers better, how they are fit to the team. More your PRs gets merged to `main` branch, **more-likely you'll be part of inner team.**
On-demand, or part-time contributions are welcome and **will be rewarded in $KSM**

KodaDot has started on [Kusama.network](https://kusama.network), we prefer to pay out for your work in $KSM which is native cryptocurrency of Kusama network, [Polkadot's Canary network](https://polkadot.network) with bearing value.

### Creating your KSM address

To create your KSM address in safely and long-term manner, we recommend you to get [Polkadot.js wallet browser extension](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-account-generation/#polkadotjs-browser-plugin). You can [learn more about creating KSM address process at official Kusama Guide](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-account-generation/)

### Sharing your address to receive transfer

After you have created an account, you can visit [your dashboard](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) to carry out your operations. Kindly navigate to the __accounts section__ using the tab options and select _[accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)_. Your available accounts will be listed and you can click on the preferred account avatar to copy address. Voilà, you are ready to receive!

> Ensure you are connected to the Kusuma Network if you want to receive payment from us. And you need to be on the "via Parity" option.

### Switching account/network

While you are on your _[accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)_ dashboard, check the top-left corner to confirm and ensure your current network. Click the avatar to see options to select from and switch as desired.

> To switch to Kusuma Network, search and select __KUSAMA__ under _KUSAMA & PARACHAINS_ and `switch` by selecting the __switch__ option at the top-most area of the opened side nav.

### Checking your KSM balance

Check `balances` under your _[accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)_ dashboard to see that. Because we use KSM, you need to ensure you are on the _Kusuma network_. Check the top-left corner to confirm and ensure your `balance` is in __KSM__. If not, kindly _switch network_ by clicking the avatar on your top-left corner, and switch to __*Kusuma*__. Your __balances__ will now be in __KSM__.

## Dynamics of Pull Requests

### Avoiding stalled PRs

### 🐞 Issues

Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

**Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.**

### Is it of good quality

* It reads well
* For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Reviewing
We (usually the core team, sometimes KodaDot engineers or support too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use KodaDot

💛 Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.

💛 Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.

💛 Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

* Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them).
* Review the content for technical accuracy.
* Review the entire pull request using the localization checklist.
* Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
* Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
* Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky.
* If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
