## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

**Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.**

* Review the entire pull request using the localization checklist.
* Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
* Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
* Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky.
* If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
