## Getting started

Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

**Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.**

* It reads well
* For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Reviewing
We (usually the core team, sometimes KodaDot engineers or support too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use KodaDot

💛 Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.

💛 Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.

💛 Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

* Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them).
* Review the content for technical accuracy.
* Review the entire pull request using the localization checklist.
* Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
* Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
* Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky.
* If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.



### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a [README](README.md) and assorted documents anyone can copy and paste, into their project
