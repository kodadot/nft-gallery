## Rewards

To scale our development and operations, we prefer paid trials to know developers better and fit the team. The more your PRs get merged to the `main` branch, the **more likely you'll be part of the inner team.**
On-demand or part-time contributions are welcome, and we will reward them in $DOT.

We prefer to pay out for your work in $DOT, the native cryptocurrency of [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network) with bearing value.

### Creating your DOT address

To create your DOT address in a safe and long-term manner, we recommend you get [Polkadot.js wallet browser extension](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-account-generation/#polkadotjs-browser-plugin). You can [learn more about creating a DOT address process at the official Polkadot Guide](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation/)

### Sharing your address to receive the reward

After creating an account, you can visit [KodaDot Transfer](https://kodadot.xyz/dot/transfer) to make a payment link. Entering an amount like 100 USD and clicking the button **COPY REWARD ME LINK** will copy the link to your clipboard, and you can share it with us, like whenever you are filling up a bug report or submitting pull-request

Your receiving address should look like this.

`https://kodadot.xyz/dot/transfer?target=${your address}&usdamount=100&donation=true`

### Switching account/network

While on your _[accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)_ dashboard, check the top-left corner to confirm and ensure your current network. Click the avatar to see options to select from and switch as desired.

### Checking your DOT balance

Check `balances` under your _[accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)_ dashboard to see that. Because we use DOT, you must ensure you are on the _Polkadot network_. Check the top-left corner to confirm and make sure your `balance` is in **DOT**. If not, kindly _switch the network_ by clicking the avatar on your top-left corner and changing to **_Polkadot_**. Your **balances** will now be in **DOT**.

Alternatively, by entering your address in the search box, you can check your balance on [Subscan](https://www.subscan.io).

### Bounty levels

Our typical payout structure for bounties is per label on the issue. Here is the table for an overview
