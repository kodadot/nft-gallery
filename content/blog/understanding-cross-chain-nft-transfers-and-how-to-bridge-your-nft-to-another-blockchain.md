## A Closer Look at interoperable NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets minted on a specific blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and identical to each other, each NFT carries a unique identifier, making it distinct and irreplaceable. These digital assets can represent various forms of ownership or digital content, including digital art, music, virtual real estate, and more.

NFTs are typically bought and sold with cryptocurrency, and thanks to smart contracts, the original creators of an NFT can earn royalties each time the NFT changes hands. This feature has revolutionized the digital content industry, providing a new revenue stream for creators and a new form of asset for investors and collectors.

## The Current State of interoperable NFTs: Challenges and Limitations

Despite their potential, NFTs are currently facing several challenges. For one, NFTs are minted and operate on specific blockchains, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. This means users can only buy, sell, or trade NFTs within the ecosystem of the respective blockchain.

The lack of interoperability between blockchains presents several issues. For instance, an NFT minted on the Solana blockchain cannot be listed for sale on an Ethereum-based marketplace without significant hurdles. This limitation fragments the NFT landscape and restricts the utility and liquidity of NFTs.

Another challenge is the high transaction costs, or 'gas fees', associated with certain blockchains. Ethereum, which hosts the majority of NFT transactions, is notorious for its fluctuating and sometimes exorbitant gas fees. These fees can act as a barrier to entry for users and potentially eat into the profits from NFT sales.

A final hurdle is the requirement for specific native currencies to process transactions on different blockchains. For instance, to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, users need to hold and transact in Ether (ETH), while Binance Smart Chain requires Binance Coin (BNB).

## Bridging the Gap: Cross-Chain NFTs

To address these challenges, developers are turning to blockchain bridgesâ€”software that allows users to transfer digital assets from one blockchain to another. These third-party applications operate by 'wrapping' your tokens, creating a version of the token that can operate on a different blockchain.

For example, suppose a user wants to sell a Solana NFT on an Ethereum-based marketplace. In that case, they can use a blockchain bridge to 'lock' their original NFT on the Solana blockchain and create a 'wrapped' version of the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. This wrapped NFT can then be sold on the Ethereum marketplace. If the user wishes to 'unwrap' their NFT and return it to the original blockchain, the third party unlocks the original token and 'burns' the wrapped one.

While blockchain bridges offer a solution to the interoperability problem, they come with their own set of challenges. These include centralized third-party control, additional gas fees, and the requirement for a cryptocurrency wallet.

## Multi-Chain NFT Marketplaces: A Temporary Solution

An immediate but partial solution to the cross-chain NFT transfer issue is the creation of NFT marketplaces that support multiple blockchains. While not very common at present, these platforms allow users to buy and sell NFTs minted on different blockchains within a single platform.

However, this solution is far from perfect. It does not address the core issue of NFT interoperability and is merely a temporary fix. What's needed is a more robust and permanent solution that allows for full cross-chain interoperability.

## A Glimpse into the Future: Cross-Chain Technology

The future of NFTs lies in cross-chain technology, which will allow users to send and receive tokens across various blockchain platforms without the need for third-party bridge software. This technology is still in its early stages of development, but it's clear that it will play a pivotal role in the NFT landscape.

Cross-chain interoperability brings several benefits, including increased scalability, user ease, standardization across multiple applications, improved chain efficiency, and encouraging more blockchain transactions. It will also allow for financial transactions between two separate blockchains, potentially reducing transaction fees and enabling the transfer of NFTs from different decentralized applications (dApps).

## Several projects are currently working on cross-chain technology. These include:

- Enjin - Recently launched Efinity's parachain, which plans to allow creators, developers, and gamers to create metaverse games with full interoperability across Parachains.
- Sygma - Aims to create cross-chain interoperability by creating decentralized direct bridges that connect multiple blockchains, without the need for a third-party exchange.
- Polkadot - Allows for cross-blockchain transfers of digital assets and provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.
- Axelar - A teleportation service that transfers NFTs across blockchains

Others on list include Axelar, Rarimo and Zetachain.

These are just a few examples, and many more projects are underway, aiming to create a fully interoperable, cross-chain NFT ecosystem.

## Real-world Applications of Cross-Chain NFTs

The potential applications of cross-chain NFTs are endless. They can revolutionize sectors like art and collectibles, decentralized finance (DeFi), virtual real estate, intellectual property licensing, and tokenization of real-world assets.

For instance, in the art and collectibles industry, cross-chain NFTs can broaden the market by allowing artists to reach a wider audience and potentially increase the value of their work. In DeFi, cross-chain NFTs can be used for collateralized loans, insurance, yield farming, and more. They can unlock the value of illiquid assets and increase the overall efficiency of DeFi markets.

Another promising application is virtual real estate. Virtual land in the metaverse, represented as NFTs, is seeing significant interest. Cross-chain NFTs can facilitate the trading and ownership of virtual real estate and in-game assets across different platforms and chains. This enhances the interoperability between game ecosystems, allowing users to transfer their virtual assets from one game to another or trade them with players on different platforms.

## The Role of Blockchain Bridges in Cross-Chain NFT Transfers

Blockchain bridges play a vital role in enabling cross-chain NFT transfers. One notable example is XP Bridge, a platform that allows the transfer of NFTs between more than 20 different networks. By connecting the user's wallet and selecting the source and destination chains, users can transfer their NFTs quickly and securely.

The XP Bridge supports a wide range of networks, including Algorand, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Cardano, Ethereum, Fantom, Harmony, Polygon, Solana, Tezos, and Tron, among others. This flexibility opens up new possibilities for NFT owners and expands the potential market for NFT trading.

## Future of Cross-Chain NFTs: Full Interoperability

In the ideal world of NFTs, users would be able to send or receive any NFT without needing a third-party entity. For instance, in crypto gaming, full interoperability between games would mean being able to transfer your hard-earned items and characters to other games or NFT marketplaces with ease.

While we're not quite there yet, the continued interest in NFTs and cryptocurrency suggests it's only a matter of time before full cross-chain interoperability becomes a reality. The development of cross-chain platforms like Axelar, Rarimo, ZetaChain, and Sygma is already paving the way for this future.

## Conclusion

While cross-chain connectivity still poses challenges, the future is bright for NFTs and their interoperability across different blockchains. Developers are continuously working on solutions like blockchain bridges and cross-chain platforms to overcome these hurdles.

It's clear that the future of NFTs lies in the ability to seamlessly transfer these digital assets across multiple blockchains. This will not only enhance the utility and liquidity of NFTs but also open up new possibilities for their application in various sectors, from gaming and art to DeFi and virtual real estate.

The potential of this technology is immense, and with the continued development and innovation in the space, it's only a matter of time before we see a fully interoperable, cross-chain NFT ecosystem come to fruition.
