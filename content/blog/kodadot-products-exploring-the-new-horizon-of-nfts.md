## KodaDot's Evolutionary Journey

Over the past two years, the team behind KodaDot has been experimenting with various facets of blockchain technology. The spring of 2021 saw a bull run that sparked a flurry of activities within the platform's primary repository. The KodaDot developers successfully managed to handle more than 5000 issues and made [over 3000 updates to the KodaDot codebase.](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed)

KodaDot's journey has been marked by successful product experiments. The team recognized the potential and need for unique branding within the cryptocurrency market. Unlike other platforms that often presented mundane logos, KodaDot seized the opportunity to create distinctive designs. They began collaborating with artists and communities, aiming to showcase premium designs from artists in their marketplace and support the community.

## Vibrant open-source community around nft marketplace

Thanks to 112 contributors and counting, KodaDot has managed to cross a few records among the open source community and set the proper contributors' ethics. They are currently developing at **190 pull requests/month**, where the previous record was **250 pull requests in 2/2022**, slowly returning to trend stronger and with proper processes. **Crossing 15k commits with 13k LOC codebase in single repository distributed among 1100 files**, make it superior coordination game-winning streaks in the next bull run, probably dominate any NFT market share with web3 tooling.

## KodaDot's Web3 Merchandise Shop

[KodaDot's web3 merchandise shop, also called KodaShop](https://shop.kodadot.xyz) has been a resounding success. The shop hit the century mark barely two months after its launch in February 2023. The shop features NFTs that enable users to reveal specific phrases for their NFT owners. It's still in private beta, and KodaDot's team has been providing onboarding assistance to interested users.

The merchandise shop has been a key component of KodaDot's branding strategy. It not only showcases unique artwork but also serves as a platform for early adopters and artists to gain visibility. As KodaDot continues to grow, the shop is expected to feature even more diverse and unique pieces.

**KodaShop is the home of 42+ community designs and over 300 sales to our loyal fans who stick with KodaDot brand** and are proud to wear our anime-styled designs. We are happy to continue on this journey. We are collecting NFT projects and partners who would like to be with us.

## The Pay-Per-Contribution Model

KodaDot has also been **exploring bounty-based models to reward contributors.** They believe in gig work and are seeking ways to incorporate these strategies across their products. **Over $600k in 1000+ on-chain bounties have been processed for contributors**, and KodaDot is continuously exploring ways to make the reward system more seamless for others.

KodaDot's pay-per-contribution model has succeeded, with code contributors receiving $KSM and $DOT rewards. Contributors who have made significant contributions are eligible for baseline payrolls, and additional bounties are offered to motivate quick delivery, even over weekends.

It's a tool that facilitates the transfer of $KSM, $DOT, and in the future, $USDT. **The KodaDot transfer has successfully processed over $500k through its transfer dialogue.** The transfer flow is currently being revamped, and soon, it will be a full-fledged app for your web3 team to use natively for payrolls

## KodaDot API - Uniquery

KodaDot boasts of offering the most endpoints for NFTs in the Polkadot ecosystem. It has been exploring ways to accommodate the customization needs of blue-chip collections and gaming collections. KodaDot's API has been a crucial tool in achieving this goal. Currently except KodaDot itself, there are few teams using KodaDot API - Uniquery for their production

## KodaDot Fandom Shops

We've been exploring ways to enhance blue-chip collections and, more importantly, accommodate customizations of storefronts required for each gaming collection of artists to feel native. Under the hood, it's supercharged by KodaDot technologies. To some extent, we've found a win-win situation. We've leveraged our KodaDot API - Uniquery and created a quick demonstration.
