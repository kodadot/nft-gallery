title: "KodaDot's Drop Page explained"
subtitle: You may notice this exciting feature that appeared a few weeks ago on KodaDotâ€Š-â€ŠPolkadot NFT marketplace. Drop Page was inspired by other marketplaces outside of the Polkadot ecosystem, but also it was a feature needed by artists. And the potential behind it? Exciting.

## Why do we need dropÂ pages?

When an NFT project plans to release a new collection, they typically make an announcement on their official Twitter or Discord platform. This announcement typically includes information about the allowlist, reveal, and drop schedule, which creates an exciting opportunity to generate excitement about the collection.

## The first versions of the KodaDot mintingÂ page

Initially, we developed an anime waifu minter as a fun feature for various crypto events. We did not have any concrete plans at that time. Our intention was to make KodaDot more engaging and interactive. The AI model we created was well-received by users who enjoyed the minting process. We programmed it to generate anime characters, and each user was able to mint one NFT, received either through mail or directly to their wallet.

We made some updates to our model, beginning with simple images and gradually improving until they reached a much higher quality.

_Kudos to [Vikival](https://twitter.com/vikiival), who spent hours programming, testing various anime AI models, and training them to our needs. He is the real MVP._

But that was just the beginning. Many events and versions passed till we got to our current Drop Page. Created by who elseâ€Š-â€Š[Vikival](https://twitter.com/vikiival) and with the help of our excellent designer [Exez](https://twitter.com/OndraPulc), we managed to get to the point we were satisfied. But Im sure we are not done yet.

## So, what is the KodaDot DropÂ Page?

When you go to https://kodadot.xyz/ and in the right-up corner select [Drops](https://kodadot.xyz/ahp/drops), you will see drops that are happening at the moment. They are time-limited collections that are created for a specific audience. The goal of these is to create a unique experience for people visiting our platform. Artists, creators, and collectors can use and, in some cases, obtain free NFTs, with extra surprises coming with each one.

Every Drop has its own unique page that can be customized to enhance the experience for artists and projects. This includes options such as setting phases, limits, availability, and schedules. You can showcase specific NFTs or provide the option for people to choose which NFT they wish to mint. The possibilities are endless!

Using our drop page is a straightforward process. All you need to do is connect your wallet and mint your NFT for free (or sometimes for a fee). Drop Page offers a customizable canvas that can cater to different needs. At the time of writing this article, there were two ongoing drops. Both were NFTs generated with the assistance of an AI minter that was trained for distinct outcomes. To mint your NFT, simply connect your wallet, and the AI model will produce a unique one for you and send it to your wallet.

## Unlockable surprise

And there's more! We've added unlockables so you can enjoy the thrill of discovering hidden rewards! Each NFT from the official [KodaDot](https://twitter.com/KodaDot) drops had hidden content available only for those who minted their NFT. You only need to check your profile to find the NFT and click "Unlockable Content" to reveal the surprise.

## A bundle of features you can combineÂ ðŸ’«

We already mentioned some of the features we implemented in this article. All of them are customizable. You can choose which one you want and which one you don't. Here is a small preview of the main features we have:

1. Dedicated times forÂ minting
   Select what day your minting starts, what hours will be available, and how long. We can adjust this to your needs. Minting one hour every day for one week? No problem. We can also include an attractive countdown so your audience can better understand upcoming events.
2. Limits
   The basic limit is selecting how many NFTs in total can be minted. This varies on your collection size, but in some cases (AI minting, generative art), this number can be adjusted regarding your preferences.
   You can also limit mints by the number of NFTs that can be minted at various times. Choose how many can be minted max during different phases. And, of course, we can show the availability of your NFTs so people know how much of them are left.
3. AIÂ tools
   We had anime waifus in our previous campaigns created by a highly trained AI model. Im sure we can also use it in your case. You just need to tell us [your idea](https://form.kodadot.xyz/drop-page-interest).
4. CustomÂ link
   Do you want your custom link to your drop page? No problem. In some exceptional cases, we can also hide your Drop so you can target a specific audience.
5. Free mintâ€Š-â€ŠPaidÂ mint
   Depends on you. You can choose.
6. Connection with our merchÂ shop
   This is one of the BEST benefits we offer. We allow you to connect your NFT collection to our merch shop and reward your loyal audience with a free merchandise drop. Depending on your budget, the size of the project, and the audience, we can offer you some starting amount for free.
7. Your design in ourÂ shop
   To make these drops even more interesting, we allow, in some cases, custom designs in our shop. You only need to deliver your design, and our shop will handle everything else.
