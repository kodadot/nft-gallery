## Understanding the Basics of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm, representing a new way of owning and trading digital assets. Unlike fungible tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are identical and interchangeable, NFTs are unique and distinguishable from one another. This uniqueness is what gives NFTs their value, similar to how a one-of-a-kind painting or a rare baseball card holds value.

## The Problem with Traditional NFTs

Traditional NFTs, while groundbreaking in their own right, have a significant vulnerability: their metadata and digital assets are typically stored off the blockchain. This off-chain data is usually stored on servers, cloud storage, or the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which presents potential issues.

For instance, if the server or cloud storage provider experiences downtime, the link to the NFT's digital asset could be broken. This means that the owner of the NFT may no longer be able to access or verify the digital asset associated with the NFT, rendering it virtually worthless.

## Enter On-Chain NFTs: A Solution to the Problem

To address the shortcomings of traditional NFTs, a new breed of NFTs has emerged: on-chain NFTs. As the name suggests, on-chain NFTs store both the metadata and the digital asset directly on the blockchain. This means that as long as the blockchain exists, the NFT and its associated digital asset will be accessible, thereby eliminating the potential issue of a broken link.

## The Technical Components of On-Chain NFTs

On-Chain NFTs consist of two key components: the metadata and the smart contracts. The metadata is the core information associated with an NFT, such as its name, custom properties, and the digital asset itself. Meanwhile, the smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts help facilitate the minting and exchange of the NFTs.

Because both the metadata and smart contracts of on-chain NFTs are stored directly on the blockchain, they are truly decentralized and do not rely on any third-party service or server.

## The Benefits of On-Chain NFTs

On-Chain NFTs come with a host of benefits that make them an ideal solution for the digital collectibles market. For one, they are immutable. Since the metadata and digital asset are stored directly on the blockchain, they cannot be altered or deleted. This means that the authenticity and ownership of an on-chain NFT can be verified at any time.

Moreover, on-chain NFTs are highly durable. Unlike traditional NFTs, which rely on third-party services for storage, on-chain NFTs exist as long as the blockchain exists. This ensures that the NFT and its associated digital asset are always accessible, regardless of external factors.

## The Challenges of On-Chain NFTs

Despite their numerous benefits, on-chain NFTs are not without their challenges. The primary obstacle is the cost associated with storing data directly on the blockchain. Given the average size of an NFT project, storing all the NFTs and their associated metadata on the blockchain can be prohibitively expensive.

For instance, when Cryptopunks, a popular NFT collection, moved to become fully on-chain, it reportedly cost the developers a whopping 73 million in gas fees. While this cost may be justifiable for high-value NFTs, it is a significant barrier for smaller projects and individual creators.

## Notable On-Chain NFT Projects

Despite the challenges, there are a number of notable projects that have embraced the on-chain NFT model. Here are a few:

### Cryptopunks

- Launched in 2017, Cryptopunks is a highly valued NFT collection that moved to be fully on-chain in 2021.

### Nouns

- An experimental collection that has grown into a successful public domain project with a thriving community and a well-developed DAO.

### On-Chain Monkey

- Claiming to be the first profile picture NFT collection to be generated on-chain in a single transaction, on-chain Monkey has made strides in reducing Ethereum gas fees.

## The Future of On-Chain NFTs

Despite the high cost associated with on-chain NFTs, their benefits are undeniable. For high-value NFTs, the cost is well worth the advantages of immutability, durability, and authenticity. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and become more efficient, the cost of on-chain storage is likely to decrease, making on-chain NFTs more accessible to a broader range of creators and collectors.

In conclusion, the rise of on-chain NFTs represents a significant milestone in the evolution of digital collectibles. By storing all data directly on the blockchain, on-chain NFTs provide a more secure and reliable solution for the digital collectibles market. While the high cost of on-chain storage is currently a barrier, the future looks bright for on-chain NFTs as blockchain technology continues to evolve and improve.

## Wrapping Up

In a nutshell, on-chain NFTs represent the next frontier in the evolution of digital collectibles. While they come with their own set of challenges, their benefits are undeniable. By storing all data directly on the blockchain, on-chain NFTs provide a level of security and reliability that is unparalleled in the digital collectibles market. As we move forward, it will be exciting to see how this new breed of NFTs shapes the future of digital assets.
