      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we

      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
      security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
      provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

      <strong> Financial Incentives </strong>

      "Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering,
      including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure,

    <p class="mb-4">
      The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if
      it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. A business
      must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service
      difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. The
      explanation must include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li class="mb-2">
        a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the

      <li class="mb-2">
        a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of
        the consumer’s data.

      We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service
      difference) in exchange for the retention, sale, or sharing of a
      consumer’s personal information.

    <p class="mb-4">
      If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such
      financial incentive and explain the price difference, as well as material
      terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference, including
      the categories of personal information that are implicated by the
      financial incentive or price or service difference.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw
