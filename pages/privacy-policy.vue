      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

    <p class="mb-4">
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
      will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
      verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
      security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
      provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
