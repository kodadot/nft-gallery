        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if

        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

        your country to residence. GenArt, Matej Nemček s.p. and yourself both
        agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
        Ljubljana, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer
        protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in Slovenia, or in the
        EU country in which you reside.

      <p class="has-text-weight-bold mb-4">Informal Negotiations</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and
        collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually,
        a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first
        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
        provided below) informally for at least ninety (90) days before
        initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
        notice from one Party to the other Party.
      </p>

      <p class="has-text-weight-bold mb-4">Binding Arbitration</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these
        Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in
        accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court
        of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having
        its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the
        application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this
        clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Vaduz,
        Liechtenstein. The language of the proceedings shall be English.
        Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of Liechtenstein.
      </p>

      <p class="has-text-weight-bold mb-4">Restrictions</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent by law, (a) no
        arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
        right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
        basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right
        or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
        capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

      <p class="has-text-weight-bold mb-4">
        Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
        (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any
        Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
        invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
        injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
        falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
        unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
