      Carbonless NFT Movement
    </h1>
    <h1 class="subtitle">
      KodaDot is going to be carbon-negative gallery, by default
    </h1>
    <p>
      We are trying to set a movement where artists can offset their mints.
      Simple as that. Even we are running on a low carbon blockchain
      <b><a href="https://Kusama.network">Kusama.network</a></b>
      and plan to roll out our own NFT-focused infrastructure parachain
      <b><a href="https://Metaprime.network">MetaPrime.network</a></b
      >, we feel that we should step up in the game and be more carbon neutral
      and later contribute to be carbon negative gallery in a way to drive
      global forestation. To help artists mitigate the negative effects of
      expanding society on the planet. At least, we might contribute to do the
      small job here. The audience will decide.

    <h1 class="title is-4">Carbon Neutral Mission of Kodadot</h1>
    <p>
      The mission of Kodadot gallery is to flow collectors' resources to
      environmentally conscious digital art creation in a way to address the
      Earth's mounting climate crisis. We have intent to bring
      <b

          >carbon calculator</a
        ></b
      >
      and help to make forestations and offsetting as new normal and easy
      access. To kick-start this effort, we've partnered with Offsetra which
      allows users to support
      <i
        >"high-quality pro-climate projects via the purchase of carbon offsets
        credits"</i
      >. <br /><br />
      Carbon offset credits come from a variety of sustainability-oriented
      projects. Offsetra only sources offsets from validated and verified
      projects under strict internationally recognized standards. You can find
      more information on <br />Offsetra's process is available
      <a href="https://offsetra.com/">on their website</a>.<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1 class="title is-4">Humble actions</h1>
    <p>
      We are aware that just by purchasing Carbon Offsets we won't solve the
      issue, but
      <b
        >we can be small butterfly effect, and later jumpstart impactful actions
        to start a forestation movement on bigger scale</b
      >, where it would be native for NFT galleries to bring with every mint,
      buying offsets in a way to put a small amount of % towards buying carbon
      offsets and forestation. We will try to put at least some amount of
      artists' profits based on their decision to drive towards buying credit
      offsets. Not just feel good about, but with a real impactful way to do
      proove it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1 class="title is-4">Building impactful environmental relief</h1>
    <p>
      Our first start is to add a toggle to our minting interface where every
      artist could choose if they want to support carbon credits or not. We will
      be adding the <b>ðŸŒ± carbonless</b>
      tag to NFT and later it could be tracked through the search interface and
      reviewed on-chain. Thus collectors might find it innovative to collect
      carbonless NFTs. Once Offsetra (or other carbon credit partners) figure
      out a way to make fiat off-ramp payments from Kusama for carbon-offsets to
      happen, we will make a full end-to-end native crypto integration with
      them, so every NFT will consist hash relying on Carbon Credit. To drive
      the vision to home, we are genuinely looking forward to starting with
      <b

          Terraformation of Planet Earth</a
        ></b
      >
      where one could participate in fashion to own part of the forest, probably
      introduce the concept of <b>Forest as a Service</b>. Imagination is the
      limit.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1 class="title is-4">We are not only one and that's great</h1>
    <p>
      We are really aware that movement is just about to begin when news outlets
      started heating discussion and
      <b
        ><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CleanNFT&src=typeahead_click">
          #cleanNFT movement</a
        ></b
      >
      has begun. One option for the creator is to
      <b>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-7Ama31sYWhXDl6NoJaXnbAV9pFbjxLIgl7jb3CHOs/edit#gid=0">
          choose from a variety of NFT platforms running on low carbon
          blockchains</a
        ></b
      >
      which is really great start. Another option is to actively drive movement
      to be
      <a href="https://offsets.gallery/">carbon-negative gallery</a>.<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1 class="title is-4">Our proof of work</h1>
    <p>
      We (Kodadot) are feeling inspired to join this movement in our fashioned
      way
      <b>to add carbonless minting for creators</b> and start showing which NFTs
      are carbonless by showing ðŸŒ± next to them. To top-up our carbon credits
