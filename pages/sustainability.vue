      Sustainability of KodaDot
    </h1>
    <h1 class="subtitle">micro-dao-bedrock-boostrap experiment</h1>
    <p>
      As part of our micro-dao-bedrock-boostrap experiment, we would like to
      keep our efforts sustainable
      <b>in the long-run and create trust from creators culture</b> and economy
      for KodaDot that we will won't dissapear tomorrow and keep running as long
      we can cover our efforts to keep it online and working.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will be slowly elaborating what is best possible way to embrace
      Creators economy needs and help them to make sustainable living out of
      their work. <b>We are here to support the case</b>. On other part, we need
      to mind our long-term sustainability. We are in position being universal
      viewer and not being landlord in form of platform as other galleries do.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Right now our only income was approved
      <a href="https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/256"
        >proposal#384 & motion#256 from Kusama Treasury funding</a
      >
      for milestone1. Mostly it went for development costs, not for running and
      further maintance costs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Out flow of funds will have three parts.
      <b
        >Artists support program, Running costs and Research & Development
        costs</b
      >. From start, we will put some of our savings into bedrock fund.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/141">
        Running costs</a
      >
      consist paying up Netlify (http, cdn, CI&CD), Pinata (IPFS), Arweave (free
      for now, later paid integration), Textile.io (we expecting this costs
      would go linear, later exponential). Maintance, R&D costs need to be paid
      as
      <a href="https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues"
        >our backlog of new features is popping up</a
      >
      and we are
      <b
        >trying invite more developers to our circles by putting bounties on
        issues</b
      >. Anyone can join and help with our efforts.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As we would like to establish our accrual vector for sustainibility fund
      and introduce <b>small fee through minting</b> through KodaDot, we will be
      adding button where you still can voluntary opt-out and mint without
      supporting us at all.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To <b>give community value back</b>, we are about to establish
      <b
        ><a href="https://hackmd.io/cy3jpAhvR-S32SUiMqEabg?edit"
          >artists-support-program</a
        ></b
      >
      which will flow back to artists. We are trying to create self-reinforcment
      accrual cycle, where you as creator supporting KodaDot gallery will flow
      back and support new artists, thus creating network effects for early
      adopters and next wave of adopters and so on, which will later could be
      self-propelled at some point if we manage to crack on the right
      tokenomics. We just need play bit more with right flow curves. It's
      experiment.

      Current holders of multisig are founders of KodaDot --
      <a href="https://twitter.com/yangwao">yangwao</a> &
      <a href="https://twitter.com/vikiival">vikiival</a>
      and later it will expand as we will create trust with broader community
      who would like to participate as we expect Treasury could grow larger next
      day.
