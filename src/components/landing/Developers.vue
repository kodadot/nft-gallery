                Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

                When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:
              </p><br>

                Does it state intent

              <p>
                You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.
                <br>For example:<br>
                <code>Add link to code of conduct in README.md</code><br><br>

                Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that<br>
                <code>Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md</code><br><br>
                <b>Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.</b>

                We (usually the core team, sometimes KodaDot engineers or support too!)

                <li>Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.</li>
